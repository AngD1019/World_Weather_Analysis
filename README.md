# World_Weather_Analysis
This challenge shows the addition of the weather description to the weather data to the PlanMyTrip app.

The idea is to use the weather description data already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, allow users to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers/users will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map were created.

This assignment consists of the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
